## Description

Code for Master's Thesis final work (master's of Data science, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya- UOC, 2020)


## Files

- **TFM_results**: code to work on results from GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) and build the 269-CSC gene signature (of commmon CSC genes enriched in Breast Cancer and Mantle Cell Lymphoma), R Markdown format.
- **TFM_Bioportal**: code to perform machine learning modeling (Random forest) to predict the prognostic power of the CSC gene signatures identified in the project.

## Considerations

The objective s of thw work have been:

- *	Identify common mechanisms related to cancer stem cells in two types of solid tumours: Breast Cancer and Mantle Cell Lymphoma.

- *	Identify genes involved in CSC machinery in BC expression datasets through pathway enrichment analysis (GSEA).

- *	Identify genes involved in CSC machinery in MCL expression datasets through pathway enrichment analysis (GSEA).

- *	Generate a common CSC-gene signature for BC and MCL.

- *	Map the molecular functions and biological processes of the genes included in the CSC-gene signature

- *	Study the prognostic significance of the genes included in the CSC-gene signature	

- *	Study the predictive power for prognosis of the CSC-gene signature using Machine Learning.
